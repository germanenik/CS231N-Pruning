## Usage
This pipeline is a combination of consecutive training and testing of GMM + TOM. GMM generates the warped clothes according to the target human. Then, TOM blends the warped clothes outputs from GMM into the target human properties, to generate the final try-on output.

1) Install the requirements
2) Download/Prepare the dataset
3) Train GMM network
4) Get warped clothes for training set with trained GMM network, and copy warped clothes & masks inside `data/train` directory
5) Train TOM network
6) Test/evaluate with test set, test GMM first, then copy warped clothes & masks inside `data/test` directory, and test TOM

## Installation
This implementation is built and tested in PyTorch 0.4.1.
Pytorch and torchvision are recommended to install with conda: `conda install pytorch=0.4.1 torchvision=0.2.1 -c pytorch`
<br/>For all packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data preparation
For training/testing VITON dataset, our full and processed dataset is available here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ai8t8GAHdzVUiQQYX0azYhqIDPP6?e=4cpFTI. After downloading, unzip to your data directory.

If you want to use the viton_resize dataset from cp-vton and do the processing manually, please run the following steps:
1) Run `python data_download.py`, it will download the full dataset into data/ folder, both train and test.
2) Run `python dataset_neck_skin_correction.py`, for both 'train' and 'test' data for training and testing. Please set the correct paths in the script before running. It will add a new segmentation label for neck/skin areas, and save the new segmentation in "image-parse-new" folder.
3) Run `python body_binary_masking.py`, for both 'train' and 'test' data for training and testing. Please set the correct paths in the script before running. It will create the body binary masks for the inputs of the networks.

## Training
Run `python train.py` with your specific usage options for GMM and TOM stage.
<br/>For example, GMM: ```python train.py --name GMM --stage GMM --workers 4 --save_count 5000 --shuffle```
<br/> Then run test.py for GMM network with the training dataset, which will generate the warped clothes and masks in "warp-cloth" and "warp-mask" folders inside the "result/GMM/train/" directory. Copy the "warp-cloth" and "warp-mask" folders into your data directory, for example inside "data/train" folder.
<br/>Run TOM stage, ```python train.py --name TOM --stage TOM --workers 4 --save_count 5000 --shuffle```

## Testing
Run 'python test.py' with your specific usage options.
<br/>For example, GMM: ```python test.py --name GMM --stage GMM --workers 4 --datamode test --data_list test_pairs.txt --checkpoint checkpoints/GMM/gmm_final.pth```
<br/> Then run test.py for GMM network with the testing dataset, which will generate the warped clothes and masks in "warp-cloth" and "warp-mask" folders inside the "result/GMM/test/" directory. Copy the "warp-cloth" and "warp-mask" folders into your data directory, for example inside "data/test" folder.
<br/>Run TOM stage: ```python test.py --name TOM --stage TOM --workers 4 --datamode test --data_list test_pairs.txt --checkpoint checkpoints/TOM/tom_final.pth```

## Inference/Demo
Download the pre-trained models from here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ai8t8GAHdzVUiQA-o3C7cnrfGN6O?e=EaRiFP.
Then run the same step as Testing to test/inference our model.
The code and pre-trained models are tested with pytorch 0.4.1, torchvision 0.2.1, opencv 4.1 and pillow 5.4.

### Testing with custom images
to run the model with custom internet images, make sure you have the following:

1) image (image of a person)
2) image-parse (you can generate with LIP_JPPNet or CIHP_PGN pretrained networks from the person image. If you use LIP_JPPNet/LIP_SSL, then you need to run dataset_neck_skin_connection.py and body_binary_masking.py after generating the segmentation files.)
3) cloth (in-shop cloth image)
4) cloth-mask (binary mask of cloth image, you can generate it with simple pillow/opencv function)
5) pose (pose keypoints of the person, generate with openpose COCO-18 model )
